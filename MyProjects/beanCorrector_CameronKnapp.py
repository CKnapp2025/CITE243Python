Program Name: Bean Counter Corrector
Author: Cameron Knapp
Date: 2025-10-22
Description:
    This program connects to a public Google Sheets
    spreadsheet containing data on beans per jar,
    number of jars, and total beans. It automatically
    checks every row to verify that the TOTAL BEANS
    column correctly equals BEANS PER JAR * JARS.
    If it finds any inconsistencies, it lists all the rows
    that contain incorrect totals.

Usage:
    1. Run the script using Python 3.x.
    2. Make sure the 'ezsheets' module is installed.
       (Install with: pip install ezsheets)
    3. The first time you use ezsheets, a browser will
       open to log into your Google account. Grant
       permission, and credentials will be saved.
    4. Run this script. It will connect to the shared
       Bean Counter spreadsheet at:
       'https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jDZEdvSIh4TmZxccyy0ZXrH-ELlrwq8_YYiZrEOB4jg'
